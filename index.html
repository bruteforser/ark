      The Eye. It may not lie, but don't think for a moment that it can't be
      lying, too. Seeing is be<b>lie</b>ving. But is it truth? Or just an
      illusion? People see the Horsemen as noble Robin Hoods. But are they? Or
      are they nothing more than common thieves? Depends on your point of view.
      Here's what you know: they robbed a bank in Paris from a stage in Las
      Vegas. They fleeced an insurance man out of hundreds of millions of
      dollars and disappeared from a roof in New York, always showering their
      devoted fans with money. Here's what you don't know: they left one man
      behind, framed, holding the bag... me. Are you listening, Horsemen? When
      you emerge, and I know you will, I will be there, waiting for you. 'Cause
      mark my words, you will get what's coming to you... in ways you can't
      expect, or imagine, but very much deserve. Because one thing I believe in
      is an <em>eye</em> for an eye.
